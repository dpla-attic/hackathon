#DPLA Platform Hackathon

This is a holding tank for resources related to the DPLA hackathon. We'll gather sample code, docs, links, and references to things produced by the hackathon here.

## Hackathon related links

Consider these links a dpla platform "crash course."

## What you should do before the hackathon

* Please look over the materials above.
* Please set up a github account as we'll be coordinating our development here. Git skills are pretty important too,  [the github docs](http://help.github.com/) are refreshingly good.

## Code Samples

Find code samples in the samples directory

## Hackathon Output

We'll fork the repositories of every hackathon participant into the main [dpla github account](https://github.com/dpla). We may change how we organize things later, but this will suffice for now. 

## Staging servers

We will provide a fairly beefy ubuntu linux VM for staging hackathon apps, and we're prepared to provision more VMs if needed. If you prefer to deploy on your own infrastructure, that's fine too. These VMs will be temporary.  We will probably promote some (hopefully all!) hackathon apps to live permanently in the dp.la infrastructure. 

We will provide sysadmin expertise to help stage your apps. We have a wide range of skills and are happy to work with you to stage apps in frameworks we're not familiar with. If you require windows hosting, we will be able to provide a minimal amount of support but can deploy a temporary VM for you.
